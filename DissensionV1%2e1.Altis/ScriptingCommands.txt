These are all commands/tricks that you can use to create unique situations using Vcom AI.



=============
==Waypoints==
=============

1)If a groups active waypoint speed is set to "FULL" they will 'charge' the waypoint and will only seek for cover when heavily suppressed.
2)If a groups active waypoint is set to "HOLD" and is ontop of a structure, they will attempt to garrsion that structure/nearby structures.
3)A group on a "HOLD" waypoint will try their best to not leave the HOLD waypoint location.
4)A on a "DESTROY" waypoint will not generate extra waypoints until their target is A)Destroyed or B)Enough time has passed.
5)AI groups with 2 or more waypoints will NOT generate extra waypoints, or move to help friendlies, when engaged in combat.
6)AI groups with these active waypoints will not generate extra waypoints: "HOLD","GUARD","UNLOAD","LOAD","TR UNLOAD","SENTRY","DESTROY"
7)AI groups with the dismissed waypoint will wander around until they are engaged in combat.

=============
==Scripting==
=============

1)To disable Vcom AI entirely on certain units put this command in their init field: "this setvariable ["NOAI",true];"
2)To disable Vcom AI entirely on a group, put this command in any unit in a squad: "{_x setvariable ["NOAI",true]} foreach units (group this);"
3)To get more feedback about what VCOM_AI is doing, put "VCOM_AIDEBUG = 1" in your init.sqf file.
4)To disable Vcom AI from creating additional waypoints or running to support friendles, put this command in their init field: "this setvariable ["VCOM_NOPATHING_Unit",true];"
5)To disable a Vcom AI group from creating additional waypoints or running to support friendlies, put this command in their init field:  "{_x setvariable ["VCOM_NOPATHING_Unit",true]} foreach units (group this);"


=============
